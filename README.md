This repository is only for my own educational purpose

You can download the app on the AppStore: https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1335744582&mt=8

it contains ugly code and a lot of trash!
Feel free to discover this jungle of a mess!

I will no longer support it as it was for educational purpose only.

I started this project without any knowledge of the Swift language and iOS Developement so don't expect this code to be the most beautifull thing you ever consider solving. Altough it's ugly and imperformant, I think it is important to open-source the code for many reasons:

- firstly it is kind of a documentation of my learning curve
- secondly it shows that you don't have to write perfect when you start programming
- thirdly there might be some crazy explorers, who want to understand my code (I don't think so)

I don't recommend to copy any of this code! And if so please improve it for your project!

I hope you can find any way to enjoy this code xD
